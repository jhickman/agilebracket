This project will provide supplemental tools for agile enterprise Java development.

The intent here is not to compete with existing frameworks, but to extend them in useful directions.  We will contribute source code upstream to the appropriate projects where that makes sense.  Sometimes, though, code will not be accepted due to a narrow scope or a conflict in project goals.

This project is more of a collection of extensions rather than a cohesive but narrowly focused framework.
